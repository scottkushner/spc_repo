  # Active Encode provides hooks during the life cycle of an encode. Callbacks allow you
  # to trigger logic during the life cycle of an encode. Available callbacks are:
  #
  # * <tt>before_create</tt>
  # * <tt>around_create</tt>
  # * <tt>after_create</tt>
  # * <tt>before_cancel</tt>
  # * <tt>around_cancel</tt>
  # * <tt>after_cancel</tt>
  # * <tt>before_purge</tt>
  # * <tt>around_purge</tt>
  # * <tt>after_purge</tt>
