## Description
This is a [Ruby][] implementation of an [EBNF][] and [BNF][] parser and parser generator. It parses [EBNF][] grammars to [BNF][], generates [First/Follow][] and Branch tables for [LL(1)][] grammars, which can be used with the stream [Tokenizer][] and [LL(1) Parser][].

As LL(1) grammars operate using `alt` and `seq` primitives, allowing for a match on alternative productions or a sequence of productions, generating a parser requires turning the EBNF rules into BNF:

* Transform `a ::= b?` into `a ::= _empty | b`
* Transform `a ::= b+` into `a ::= b b*`
* Transform `a ::= b*` into `a ::= _empty | (b a)`
* Transform `a ::= op1 (op2)` into two rules:
  ```
  a     ::= op1 _a_1
  _a_1_ ::= op2
  ```

Of note in this implementation is that the tokenizer and parser are streaming, so that they can process inputs of arbitrary size.

## Usage
### Parsing an LL(1) Grammar

    require 'ebnf'

    ebnf = EBNF.parse(File.open('./etc/ebnf.bnf'))

Output rules and terminals as S-Expressions, Turtle or EBNF

    puts ebnf.to_sxp
    puts ebnf.to_ttl
    puts ebnf.to_ebnf

Transform EBNF to BNF (generates sub-productions using `alt` or `seq` from `plus`, `star` or `opt`)

    ebnf.make_bnf

Generate [First/Follow][] rules for BNF grammars

    ebnf.first_follow(start_tokens)

Generate Terminal, [First/Follow][], Cleanup and Branch tables as Ruby for parsing grammars

    ebnf.to_ruby

Generate formatted grammar using HTML (requires [Haml][Haml] gem)

    ebnf.to_html

### Parser S-Expressions
Intermediate representations of the grammar may be serialized to Lisp-like S-Expressions. For example, the rule `[1] ebnf        ::= (declaration | rule)*` is serialized as `(rule ebnf "1" (star (alt declaration rule)))`.

Once the [LL(1)][] conversion is made, the [First/Follow][] table is generated, this rule expands as follows:

     (rule ebnf "1"
      (start #t)
      (first "@pass" "@terminals" LHS _eps)
      (follow _eof)
      (cleanup star)
      (alt _empty _ebnf_2))
     (rule _ebnf_1 "1.1"
      (first "@pass" "@terminals" LHS)
      (follow "@pass" "@terminals" LHS _eof)
      (alt declaration rule))
     (rule _ebnf_2 "1.2"
      (first "@pass" "@terminals" LHS)
      (follow _eof)
      (cleanup merge)
      (seq _ebnf_1 ebnf))
     (rule _ebnf_3 "1.3" (first "@pass" "@terminals" LHS _eps) (follow _eof) (seq ebnf))

### Creating terminal definitions and parser rules to parse generated grammars
The parser is initialized to callbacks invoked on entry and exit
to each `terminal` and `production`. A trivial parser loop can be described as follows:

    require 'ebnf/ll1/parser'
    require 'meta'

    class Parser
      include Meta

      terminal(:SYMBOL, /([a-z]|[A-Z]|[0-9]|_)+/) do |prod, token, input|
        # Add data based on scanned token to input
        input[:symbol] = token.value
      end

      start_production(:rule) do |input, current, callback|
        # Process on start of production
        # Set state for entry into recursed rules through current

        # Callback to parser loop with callback
      end

      production(:rule) do |input, current, callback|
        # Process on end of production
        # return results in input, retrieve results from recursed rules in current

        # Callback to parser loop with callback
      end

      def initialize(input)
        parser_options = {
          branch: BRANCH,
          first: FIRST,
          follow: FOLLOW,
          cleanup: CLEANUP
        }
        parse(input, start_symbol, parser_options) do |context, *data|
          # Process calls from callback from productions

        rescue ArgumentError, RDF::LL1::Parser::Error => e
          progress("Parsing completed with errors:\n\t#{e.message}")
          raise RDF::ReaderError, e.message if validate?
        end

### Branch Table
The Branch table is a hash mapping production rules to a hash relating terminals appearing in input to sequence of productions to follow when the corresponding input terminal is found. This allows either the `seq` primitive, where all terminals map to the same sequence of productions, or the `alt` primitive, where each terminal may map to a different production.

    BRANCH = {
      :alt => {
        "(" => [:seq, :_alt_1],
        :ENUM => [:seq, :_alt_1],
        :HEX => [:seq, :_alt_1],
        :O_ENUM => [:seq, :_alt_1],
        :O_RANGE => [:seq, :_alt_1],
        :RANGE => [:seq, :_alt_1],
        :STRING1 => [:seq, :_alt_1],
        :STRING2 => [:seq, :_alt_1],
        :SYMBOL => [:seq, :_alt_1],
      },
      ...
      :declaration => {
        "@pass" => [:pass],
        "@terminals" => ["@terminals"],
      },
      ...
    }

In this case the `alt` rule is `seq ('|' seq)*` can happen when any of the specified tokens appears on the input stream. The all cause the same token to be passed to the `seq` rule and follow with `_alt_1`, which handles the `('|' seq)*` portion of the rule, after the first sequence is matched.

The `declaration` rule is `@terminals' | pass` using the `alt` primitive determining the production to run based on the terminal appearing on the input stream. Eventually, a terminal production is found and the token is consumed.

### First/Follow Table
The [First/Follow][] table is a hash mapping production rules to the terminals that may proceed or follow the rule. For example:

    FIRST = {
      :alt => [
        :HEX,
        :SYMBOL,
        :ENUM,
        :O_ENUM,
        :RANGE,
        :O_RANGE,
        :STRING1,
        :STRING2,
        "("],
      ...
    }

### Terminals Table
This table is a simple list of the terminal productions found in the grammar. For example:

    TERMINALS = ["(", ")", "-",
      "@pass", "@terminals",
      :ENUM, :HEX, :LHS, :O_ENUM, :O_RANGE,:POSTFIX,
      :RANGE, :STRING1, :STRING2, :SYMBOL,"|"
    ].freeze

### Cleanup Table
This table identifies productions which used EBNF rules, which are transformed to BNF for actual parsing. This allows the parser, in some cases, to reproduce *star*, *plus*, and *opt* rule matches. For example:

    CLEANUP = {
      :_alt_1 => :star,
      :_alt_3 => :merge,
      :_diff_1 => :opt,
      :ebnf => :star,
      :_ebnf_2 => :merge,
      :_postfix_1 => :opt,
      :seq => :plus,
      :_seq_1 => :star,
      :_seq_2 => :merge,
    }.freeze

In this case the `ebnf` rule was `(declaration | rule)*`. As BNF does not support a star operator, this is decomposed into a set of rules using `alt` and `seq` primitives:

    ebnf    ::= _empty _ebnf_2
    _ebnf_1 ::= declaration | rule
    _ebnf_2 ::= _ebnf_1 ebnf
    _ebnf_3 ::= ebnf

The `_empty` production matches an empty string, so allows for now value. `_ebnf_2` matches `declaration | rule` (using the `alt` primitive) followed by `ebnf`, creating a sequence of zero or more `declaration` or `alt` members.

## EBNF Grammar
The [EBNF][] variant used here is based on [W3C](http://w3.org/) [EBNF][] (see {file:etc/ebnf.ebnf EBNF grammar}) as defined in the
[XML 1.0 recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/), with minor extensions:

* Comments include `\\` and `#` through end of line (other than hex character) and `/* ... */ (* ... *) which may cross lines`
* All rules **MAY** start with an identifier, contained within square brackets. For example `[1] rule`, where the value within the brackets is a symbol `([a-z] | [A-Z] | [0-9] | "_" | ".")+`
* `@terminals` causes following rules to be treated as terminals. Any terminal which are entirely upper-case are also treated as terminals
* `@pass` defines the expression used to detect whitespace, which is removed in processing.
* No support for `wfc` (well-formedness constraint) or `vc` (validity constraint).

Parsing this grammar yields an S-Expression version: {file:etc/ebnf.ll1.sxp}.

## Example parser
For an example parser built using this gem, see {file:examples/ebnf-parser/README EBNF Parser example}. This example creates a parser for the [EBNF][] grammar which generates the same Abstract Syntax Tree as the built-in parser in the gem.

##  Acknowledgements
Much of this work, particularly the generic parser, is inspired by work originally done by
Tim Berners-Lee's Python [predictive parser](http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/grammar/predictiveParser.py).

The EBNF parser was inspired by Dan Connolly's
[EBNF to Turtle processor](http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/grammar/ebnf2turtle.py),
[EBNF to BNF Notation-3 rules](http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/grammar/ebnf2bnf.n3),
and [First Follow Notation-3 rules](http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/grammar/first_follow.n3).
