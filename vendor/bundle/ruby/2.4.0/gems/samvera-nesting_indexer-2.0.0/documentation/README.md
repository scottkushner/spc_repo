For generating a JPG from a mermaid file, you may use the [mermaid.cli tool](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli) or use the [atom-mermaid](https://atom.io/packages/atom-mermaid) plugin for the [Atom editor](https://atom.io).

## Using atom-mermaid

* From Atom, install the 'atom-mermaid' package and restart Atom.
* Then go to the corresponding `.mermaid` file
* Select the Atom menu item Packages > Mermaid Preview > Toggle Preview
* Right-Click on the opened preview and select "Save as PNG"
* Copy the saved PNG to the appropriate location (e.g. `./documentation/`)

## Using mermaid.cli

You'll need to give it a try.
