h2. 3.2.0
  #25 Allow any field_value except nil to be inserted into a solr field
  #24 Remove dependency on solrizer-fedora, use AF to update index by pid
  #23 Enhance Suffix#config so it can be usefully overridden by downstream 

h2. 3.1.1
  #22 Support for boolean values
  #21 Testing on Rails version 4

h2. 3.1.0
  #16 Inserting non-multivalued fields should not create a solr error
  #20 Time fields should be formatted correctly when using active_support/core_ext/date_time/conversions
  #17 Solrizer should accept DateTime objects

h2. 3.0.0 (2013-03-28)
suffix changes:  
  _s -> _sim
  _t -> _tesim
  _dt -> _dtsi
  _i  -> _isim
  _sort -> _ssi
  _display -> _sim
  _facet   -> _sim
  _unstem_search -> _tim

Default Descriptors have been added: stored_searchable, searchable, dateable, facetable, symbol, sortable, displayable, unstemmed_searchable, simple


h2. 2.1.0
#11 There should only be one instance of the field mapper. It's now at Solrizer.default_field_mapper
Extract create_and_insert_terms into Solrizer::Common.  This can be used for RDF datastreams
Raise helpful error message if date can't be parsed.
Don't add searchable terms when another kind of field is added (continuation of HYDRA-827)
** Upgrade note: Delete your config/solr_mappings.yml file, unless you have customized it. It's presence disables Solrizer::FieldMapper::Default **

h2. 2.0.0
HYDRA-827 DO NOT index terms by default
HYDRA-863 Null pointer exception fixed.
BUG: Replaced data_type method with type which was causing the :type option in OM terms not to work.  This makes certain tests not pass under Ruby 1.8.7, specifically when using :type option with a proxied term in OM.
BUG: Fixed TerminologyBasedSolrizer#solrize_node instance method to call class method correctly, and changed #solrize_term to call instance method #solrize_node so that it can be overridden by subclasses
Test fixes such as properly testing solr field suffixes when using the :type option in OM as well as using correct ISO.8601 dates in our fixtures
HYDRA-876 When solrizing OM documents, term_values is called instead of find_by_terms which ensures data types are deserialized correctly.  Dates are also converted to ISO 8601 format, both when intgrating with OM or when using solrized independently.

h2. 1.2.2
BUG: RSolr::Client doesn't have a delete method.  Changed to delete_by_id. (only affects solrizer shell script)  Thanks to mkorcy.

h2. 1.2.1
BUG: name mappings message is a "debug" message, not "info"
fixed rake tasks to include coverage properly
changed email, summary, description in gemspec

h2. 1.2.0
Upgrade to om 1.5.
Now works with ruby 1.9

h2. 1.1.2

BUG: Not responding to messages of type: "modifyDatastreamByValue"

h2. 1.1.1

BUG: Trying to index the children of proxy terms (can't access them in OM).  Added a check to make sure it doesn't do this.
BUG: Not responding to messages of type: "modifyDatastreamByReference"
BUG: Not logging unavailable message types

h2. 1.0.3

BUG: Extractor.format_field_values was choking when value was nil

h2. 1.0.0

Deprecated

* extract_tag
* extract_tags
* extract_hash


All solrize and extract methods now accept and return a _Hash_ rather than a Solr::Document
Removed dependency on outdated "solr" gem, replaced it with RSolr
As part of this switch, *all field names are stored as Strings, not Symbols*. If you previously accessed something as solr_doc[:title_t], now you need to access it as solr_doc["title_t"] 

Moved #format_node_value and #insert_solr_field_value from TerminologyBasedSolrizer to Solrizer::Extractor 

h2. 0.3.1

fix in require statements

h2. 0.3.0

HYDRA-286 Re-structure Solrizer to separate solrizer base from fedora-solrizer 

Added TerminologyBasedSolrizer
Added Extremely Configurable FieldMapper
Updated FieldNameMapper to use new FieldMapper

h2. 0.1.2

Minor: switched active-fedora gem requirement to >= 1.1.5 instead of = 1.1.5 (was breaking apps that use later versions of active-fedora)
