      comment: %(The GoodRelations ontology provides the vocabulary for annotating e-commerce offerings \(1\) to sell, lease, repair, dispose, or maintain commodity products and \(2\) to provide commodity services.

GoodRelations allows describing the relationship between \(1\) Web resources, \(2\) offerings made by those Web resources, \(3\) legal entities, \(4\) prices, \(5\) terms and conditions, and the aforementioned ontologies for products and services \(6\).

      comment: %(A delivery charge specification is a conceptual entity that specifies the additional costs asked for the delivery of a given gr:Offering using a particular gr:DeliveryMethod by the respective gr:BusinessEntity. A delivery charge specification is characterized by \(1\) a monetary amount per order, specified as a literal value of type float in combination with a currency, \(2\) the delivery method, \(3\) the target country or region, and \(4\)  whether this charge includes local sales taxes, namely VAT.
A gr:Offering may be linked to multiple gr:DeliveryChargeSpecification nodes that specify alternative charges for disjoint combinations of target countries or regions, and delivery methods.

Examples: Delivery by direct download is free of charge worldwide, delivery by UPS to Germany is 10 Euros per order, delivery by mail within the US is 5 Euros per order.

The total amount of this charge is specified as a float value of the gr:hasCurrencyValue property. The currency is specified via the gr:hasCurrency datatype property. Whether the price includes VAT or not is indicated by the gr:valueAddedTaxIncluded property. The gr:DeliveryMethod to which this charge applies is specified using the gr:appliesToDeliveryMethod object property. The region or regions to which this charge applies is specified using the gr:eligibleRegions property, which uses ISO 3166-1 and ISO 3166-2 codes.

If the price can only be given as a range, use gr:hasMaxCurrencyValue and gr:hasMinCurrencyValue for the upper and lower bounds.

Products or services are types of goods in the economic sense. For an overview of goods and commodities in economics, see Milgate \(1987\).

Examples: MyThinkpad T60, the pint of beer standing in front of me, my Volkswagen Golf, the haircut that I received or will be receiving at a given date and time.

    term :Location,
      comment: %(A location is a point or area of interest from which a particular product or service is available, e.g. a store, a bus stop, a gas station, or a ticket booth. The difference to gr:BusinessEntity is that the gr:BusinessEntity is the legal entity \(e.g. a person or corporation\) making the offer, while gr:Location is the store, office, or place. A chain restaurant will e.g. have one legal entity but multiple restaurant locations. Locations are characterized by an address or geographical position and a set of opening hour specifications for various days of the week.
		
Example: A rental car company may offer the Business Function Lease Out of cars from two locations, one in Fort Myers, Florida, and one in Boston, Massachussetts. Both stations are open 7:00 - 23:00 Mondays through Saturdays.

Note: Typical address standards \(vcard\) and location data \(geo, WGC84\) should be attached to a gr:Location node. Since there already exist established vocabularies for this, the GoodRelations ontology does not provide respective attributes. Instead, the use of respective vocabularies is recommended. However, the gr:hasGlobalLocationNumber property is  provided for linking to public identifiers for business locations.

An offering may be constrained in terms of the eligible type of business partner, countries, quantities, and other commercial properties. The definition of the commercial properties, the type of product offered, and the business function are explained in other parts of this vocabulary in more detail.

      comment: %(A product or service model is a intangible entity that specifies some characteristics of a group of similar, usually mass-produced products, in the sense of a prototype. In case of mass-produced products, there exists a relation gr:hasMakeAndModel between the actual product or service \(gr:Individual or gr:SomeItems\) and the prototype \(gr:ProductOrServiceModel\). GoodRelations treats product or service models as "prototypes" instead of a completely separate kind of entities, because this allows using the same domain-specific properties \(e.g. gr:weight\) for describing makes and models and for describing actual products.

Examples: Ford T, Volkswagen Golf, Sony Ericsson W123 cell phone

Note: An actual product or service \(gr:Individual\) by default shares the features of its model \(e.g. the weight\). However, this requires non-standard reasoning. See http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Axioms for respective rule sets.

    term :UnitPriceSpecification,
      comment: %(A unit price specification is a conceptual entity that specifies the price asked for a given gr:Offering by the respective gr:Business Entity. An offering may be linked to multiple unit price specifications that specify alternative prices for non-overlapping sets of conditions \(e.g. quantities or sales regions\) or with differing validity periods. 

A unit price specification is characterized by \(1\) the lower and upper limits and the unit of measurement of the eligible quantity, \(2\) by a monetary amount per unit of the product or service, and \(3\)  whether this prices includes local sales taxes, namely VAT.
	
Example: The price, including VAT, for 1 kg of a given material is 5 Euros per kg for 0 - 5 kg and 4 Euros for quantities above 5 kg.

The eligible quantity interval for a given price is specified using the object property gr:hasEligibleQuantity, which points to an instance of gr:QuantitativeValue. The currency is specified using the gr:hasCurrency property, which points to an ISO 4217 currency code. The unit of measurement for the eligible quantity is specified using the gr:hasUnitOfMeasurement datatype property, which points to an UN/CEFACT Common Code \(3 characters\).
	
In most cases, the appropriate unit of measurement is the UN/CEFACT Common Code "C62" for "Unit or piece", since a gr:Offering is defined by the quantity and unit of measurement of all items included \(e.g. "1 kg of bananas plus a 2 kg of apples"\). As long at the offering consists of only one item, it is also possible to use an unit of measurement of choice for specifying the price per unit. For bundles, however, only  "C62" for "Unit or piece" is a valid unit of measurement.

You can assume that the price is given per unit or piece if there is no gr:hasUnitOfMeasurement property attached to the price.
	
Whether VAT and sales taxes are included in this price is specified using the property gr:valueAddedTaxIncluded \(xsd:boolean\).
	
The price per unit of measurement is specified as a float value of the gr:hasCurrencyValue property. The currency is specified via the gr:hasCurrency datatype property. Whether the price includes VAT or not is indicated by the gr:valueAddedTaxIncluded datatype property.

The property priceType can be used to indicate that the price is a retail price recommendation only \(i.e. a list price\). 

If the price can only be given as a range, use gr:hasMaxCurrencyValue and gr:hasMinCurrencyValue for the upper and lower bounds.

Important: When querying for the price, always use gr:hasMaxCurrencyValue and gr:hasMinCurrencyValue.

Note 1: Due to the complexity of pricing scenarios in various industries, it may be necessary to create extensions of this fundamental model of price specifications. Such can be done easily by importing and refining the GoodRelations ontology.

Note 2: For Google, attaching a gr:validThrough statement to a gr:UnitPriceSpecification is mandatory.

    property :hasStockKeepingUnit,
      comment: %(The Stock Keeping Unit, or SKU is a unique identifier for a product, service, or bundle from the perspective of a particular supplier, i.e. SKUs are mostly assigned and serialized at the merchant level. 
Examples of SKUs are the ordering or parts numbers used by a particular Web shop or catalog.

Consequently, the domain of gr:hasStockKeepingUnit is the union of the classes gr:Offering and gr:ProductOrService. 
If attached to a gr:Offering, the SKU will usually reflect a merchant-specific identifier, i.e. one valid only for that particular retailer or shop. 
If attached to a gr:ProductOrServiceModel, the SKU can reflect either the identifier used by the merchant or the part number used by the official manufacturer of that part. For the latter, gr:hasMPN is a better choice.

Important: Be careful when assuming two products or services instances or offering instances to be identical based on the SKU. Since SKUs are unique only for the same gr:BusinessEntity, this can be assumed only when you are sure that the two SKU values refer to the same business entity. Such can be done by taking into account the provenance of the data. As long as instances of gr:Offering are concerned, you can also check that the offerings are being offered by the same gr:Business Entity.

Usually, the properties gr:hasEAN_UCC-13 and gr:hasGTIN-14 are much more reliable identifiers, because they are globally unique.
