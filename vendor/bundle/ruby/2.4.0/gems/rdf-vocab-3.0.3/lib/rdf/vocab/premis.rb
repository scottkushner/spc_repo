For example, it is not uncommon for certain versions of software to be known for causing conversion errors or introducing artifacts.

The creatingApplication container is repeatable if more than one application processed the object in turn. For example, a file could be created by Microsoft Word and later turned into a PDF using Adobe Acrobat. Details of both the Word and Acrobat applications may be recorded. However, if both files are stored in the repository, each file should be completely described as an Object entity and linked by using relationship information with a relationshipType “derivation.” It may also be repeated to record the creating application before the object was ingested as well as the creating application used as part of the ingest process. For example, an HTML file was created pre-ingest using Dreamweaver, and the Web crawler Heritrix then captured a snapshot of the files as part of the ingest. The amount of information needed for creatingApplication given here is minimal. For more granularity, extensibility is provided. Rather than having each repository record this locally, it would be preferable to have a registry of this information similar to format or environment registries.".freeze,

      "skos:scopeNote": "Usage Notes: To perform a fixity check, a message digest calculated at some earlier time is compared with a message digest calculated at a later time. If the digests are the same, the object was not altered in the interim. Recommended practice is to use two or more message digests calculated by different algorithms. (Note that the terms “message digest” and “checksum” are commonly used interchangeably. However, the term “checksum” is more correctly used for the product of a cyclical redundancy check (CRC), whereas the term “message digest” refers to the result of a cryptographic hash function, which is what is referred to here.) The act of performing a fixity check and the date it occurred would be recorded as an Event. The result of the check would be recorded as the eventOutcome. Therefore, only the messageDigestAlgorithm and messageDigest need to be recorded as objectCharacteristics for future comparison. Representation level: It could be argued that if a representation consists of a single file or if all the files comprised by a representation are combined (e.g., zipped) into a single file, then a fixity check could be performed on the representation. However, in both cases the fixity check is actually being performed on a file, which in this case happens to be coincidental with a representation. Bitstream level: Message digests can be computed for bitstreams although they are not as common as with files. For example, the JPX format, which is a JPEG2000 format, supports the inclusion of MD5 or SHA-1 message digests in internal metadata that was calculated on any range of bytes of the file.".freeze,

      "skos:historyNote": "Creation / Maintenance Notes: The format of a file or bitstream should be ascertained by the repository on ingest. Even if this information is provided by the submitter, directly in metadata or indirectly via the file name extension, recommended practice is to independently identify the format by parsing the file when possible. If the format cannot be identified at the time of ingest, it is valid to record that it is unknown, but the repository should subsequently make an effort to identify the format, even if manual intervention is required.".freeze,

For example, a bitstream in LaTex format could be embedded within an SGML file, or multiple images using different colorspaces could be embedded within a TIFF file. format must be recorded for every object. When the bitstream format can be recognized by the repository and the repository might want to treat the bitstream differently from the embedding file for preservation purposes, format can be recorded for embedded bitstreams.

In other cases, for example, for media art, the significant properties may be unique to each individual object. Where values are unique, they must be supplied by the submitter or provided by the curatorial staff of the repository.".freeze,
      "skos:scopeNote": "Usage Notes: All of this semantic unit’s subunits are optional. At least one of the significantPropertiesValue and significantPropertiesExtension subunits must be present if this container is included or both may be used. Significant properties may be objective technical characteristics subjectively considered important, or subjectively determined characteristics. For example, a PDF may contain links that are not considered important and JavaScript that is considered important. Or future migrations of a TIFF image may require optimization for line clarity or for color; the option chosen would depend upon a curatorial judgment of the significant properties of the image. Listing significant properties implies that the repository plans to preserve these properties across time and requires them to acceptably survive preservation action; for example, to be maintained during emulation or after format migration. It also implies that the repository would note when preservation action results in modification of significant properties. In practice, significant properties might be used as measures of preservation success, as part of quality checking the results of a preservation action or evaluating the efficacy of a preservation method. For example, if the listed significant properties are not maintained after application of a particular preservation method, it may indicate a failure of the process or that the method is not well suited to the type of material. More experience with digital preservation is needed to determine the best ways of representing significant properties in general, and of representing modification of significant properties. The semantic units included in the significantProperties container aim to provide a flexible structure for describing significant properties, allowing general types of aspects, facets or attributes of an object to be declared and to be paired with specific significant details about the object pertaining to that aspect, facet or attribute. For example, some repositories may define significant properties for objects related to facets of content, appearance, structure, behavior, and context. Examples of facet:detail pairs in this case could include: significantPropertiesType = “content” significantPropertiesValue = “all textual content and images” significantPropertiesType = “behavior” significantPropertiesValue = “editable” Other repositories may choose to describe significant properties at a more granular attribute level; for example: significantPropertiesType = “page count” significantPropertiesValue = “7” significantPropertiesType = “page width” significantPropertiesValue = “210 mm” Each facet:detail pair should be contained in a separate, repeated significantProperties container. Further work on determining and describing significant properties may yield more detailed schemes to facilitate general description. Representing modification of significant properties as a result of preservation action also requires further work. One possible way involves the use of Object and Event information: Object A has significant properties volume and timing, which are recorded as significantProperties of A. In migrated version B, the timing is modified, which is noted in the eventOutcome of the migration event. Only volume is listed as a significant property of B.".freeze,

For example, file A may be compressed to create file B, which is encrypted to create file C. To recreate a copy of the base file A, one would have to unencrypt file C to create file B and then uncompress file B to create file A. A compositionLevel of zero indicates that the object is a base object and not subject to further decoding, while a level of 1 or higher indicates that one or more decodings must be applied. Numbering goes lowest to highest (first encoded = 0). 0 is base object; 1-n are subsequent encodings. Use 0 as the default if there is only one compositionLevel. When multiple file objects are bundled together as filestreams within a package file object (e.g., a ZIP file), the individual filestream objects are not composition levels of the package file object. They should be considered separate objects, each with their own composition levels. For example, two encrypted files zipped together and stored in an archive as one file object would be described as three separate objects, each with its own associated metadata. The storage location of the two inner objects would point to the ZIP file, but the ZIP file itself would have only a single composition level (of zero) whose format would be “zip.”".freeze,
