    term :E10_Transfer_of_Custody,
      comment: %(This class comprises transfers of physical custody of objects between instances of E39 Actor. 
The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E10 Transfer of Custody there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances it may describe:
1.	the beginning of custody 
2.	the end of custody 
3.	the transfer of custody 
4.	the receipt of custody from an unknown source
5.	the declared loss of an object
The distinction between the legal responsibility for custody and the actual physical possession of the object should be expressed using the property P2 has type \(is type of\). A specific case of transfer of custody is theft.
The interpretation of the museum notion of "accession" differs between institutions. The CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.

    term :E11_Modification,
      comment: %(This class comprises all instances of E7 Activity that create, alter or change E24 Physical Man-Made Thing. 
This class includes the production of an item from raw materials, and other so far undocumented objects, and the preventive treatment or restoration of an object for conservation. 
Since the distinction between modification and production is not always clear, modification is regarded as the more generally applicable concept. This implies that some items may be consumed or destroyed in a Modification, and that others may be produced as a result of it. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities. 
If the instance of the E29 Design or Procedure utilized for the modification prescribes the use of specific materials, they should be documented using property P68 foresees use of \(use foreseen by\): E57 Material of E29 Design or Procedure, rather than via P126 employed \(was employed in\): E57 Material.

    term :E12_Production,
      comment: %(This class comprises activities that are designed to, and succeed in, creating one or more new items. 
It specializes the notion of modification into production. The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered “new” if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one. 
This entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event. 
An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.

    term :E13_Attribute_Assignment,
      comment: %(This class comprises the actions of making assertions about properties of an object or any relation between two items or concepts. 
This class allows the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. All the attributes or properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly attached to the respective item or concept, possibly as a collection of contradictory values. All cases of properties in this model that are also described indirectly through an action are characterised as "short cuts" of this action. This redundant modelling of two alternative views is preferred because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the action or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can be captured by simple rules. 
In particular, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain museum procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on if this information should be accessible by structured queries.

    term :E15_Identifier_Assignment,
      comment: %(This class comprises activities that result in the allocation of an identifier to an instance of E1 CRM Entity. An E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.
Examples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers \(DOI\). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.
The fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier \(is preferred identifier of\): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as “preferred identifier assignment”, to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment via the P2 has type property.

Examples include measuring the monetary value of a collection of coins or the running time of a specific video cassette. 
The E16 Measurement may use simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Details of methods and devices are best handled as free text, whereas basic techniques such as "carbon 14 dating" should be encoded using P2 has type \(is type of:\) E55 Type.

    term :E26_Physical_Feature,
      comment: %(This class comprises identifiable features that are physically attached in an integral way to particular physical objects. 
Instances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-, two- or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not. 
Instances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified \(or sometimes removed\) carrying the complete feature. 
This definition coincides with the definition of "fiat objects" \(Smith & Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420\), with the exception of aggregates of “bona fide objects”.

    term :E4_Period,
      comment: %(This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations bounded in time and space.

It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal bounds. These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture. As the actual extent of an E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period, the open spaces via which they have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event, such as the air in a meeting room transferring the voices. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas. In these cases, the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are not regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent. Consequently, instances of E4 Period may occupy each a limited number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the total timespan covered by these spacetime volumes.

Typically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. Geopolitical units may be distributed over disconnected areas, such as islands or colonies. In such cases, the spatiotemporal extent is composed of more than one spacetime volume. One may argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units. Nevertheless, an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. I.e., if it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole, but it may involve one area after another, such as the Polynesian migration, as long as it is ongoing at least in one area.

There are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.

There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included \(among others\) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.
Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.

Time Span has no other semantic connotations. Time-Spans are used to define the temporal extent of instances of E4 Period, E5 Event and any other phenomena valid for a certain time. An E52 Time-Span may be identified by one or more instances of E49 Time Appellation. 
Since our knowledge of history is imperfect, instances of E52 Time-Span can best be considered as approximations of the actual Time-Spans of temporal entities. The properties of E52 Time-Span are intended to allow these approximations to be expressed precisely.  An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. Used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it would nevertheless define them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else was known.

      comment: %(This class comprises extents in space, in particular on the surface of the earth, in the pure sense of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter. 
The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.
 It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.
Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a "section" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.).freeze,

An instance of E54 Dimension represents the true quantity, independent from its numerical approximation, e.g. in inches or in cm. The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of an instance of E54 Dimension. If the true values belong to a non-discrete space, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that interoperability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.

Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names.
The criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria.

Typical scenarios include the detachment of an accessory, the removal of a component or part of a composite object, or the deaccessioning of an object from a curated E78 Collection. If the E80 Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object into pieces, such that the whole ceases to exist, the activity should instead be modelled as an E81 Transformation, i.e. a simultaneous destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity subsequent to its removal, the activity should be regarded as both E80 Part Removal and E12 Production. This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history, and continuity of identity over time, of objects that are removed from other objects, such as precious gemstones being extracted from different items of jewelry, or cultural artifacts being deaccessioned from different museum collections over their lifespan.

The class also applies to the establishment or loss of ownership of instances of E18 Physical Thing. It does not, however, imply changes of any other kinds of right. The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E8 Acquisition there is either no donor or no recipient.

1.	the beginning of ownership

3.	the transfer of ownership
4.	the acquisition from an unknown source 
5.	the loss of title due to destruction of the item
It may also describe events where a collector appropriates legal title, for example by annexation or field collection. The interpretation of the museum notion of "accession" differs between institutions. The CRM therefore models legal ownership \(E8 Acquisition\) and physical custody \(E10 Transfer of Custody\) separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.

    term :"E91_Co-Reference_Assignment",
      comment: %(This class comprises actions of making the assertion whether two or more particular instances of E89 Propositional Object refer to the same instance of E1 CRM Entity. The assertion is based on the assumption that this was an implicit fact being made explicit by this assignment. Use of this class allows for the full description of the context of this assignment. The Actor making the assertion may have different kinds of confidence in the truth of the asserted fact of co-reference, because it may imply an interpretation of the \(past\) knowledge behind the propositional objects assumed to be co-referring. This kind of confidence can be described by using the property P2 has type \(is type of\). In case different propositional attitudes should be expressed per asserted propositional object, the assertion has accordingly to be divided into one instance of E91 Co-Reference Assignment for each kind of confidence.
This class aims at the problem of interpreting within a particular passage of an historical text, to which real-world entity a particular name, pronoun or equivalent expression was intended to refer by the texts author. In other words, it expresses the uncertainty of the creator of the assertion about the meaning of the information provided by another person.
Each such interpretation can only be documented with respect to another reference – either found in another text by the same or a different author, and/or by referring to the world known to the creator of the co-reference assertion. To do the latter, the property P155 has co-reference target \(is co-reference target of\) allows for referring to an instance of CRM Entity of the creator’s world. In a sense, the respective instance of E91 Co-Reference Assignment using the property P155 has co-reference target \(is co-reference target of\) in a knowledge base forms propositional object referring to the creator’s target entity, since a knowledge base as a whole can be seen as a propositional object. Consequently, if in a Semantic Web implementation the target entity is instantiated by a URI, the meaning of this identifier must be unambiguous to the creator of the co-reference assignment. Similarly, a URI of another authority, such as an author catalogue of a library, can be interpreted as a referring proposition of this catalogue, and be referred to by the property P153 assigned co-reference to \(was regarded to co-refer by\) or P154 assigned non co-reference to \(was regarded not to co-refer by\): E89 Propositional Object in order to express that it does not immediately represent the creator’s known world. In this case, the authority that knows the meaning of this URI must be unambiguous by the form of the URI itself.
In contrast, the meaning of the property ‘owl:same_as’ of the OWL knowledge representation language cannot specify who’s knowledge it represents and cannot express kind of confidence. Therefore it is not adequate to model the progress of scholarly co-reference research.

    property :P156_occupies,
      comment: %(This property describes the maximal real volume in space that an instance of E18 Physical Thing has occupied during its lifetime with respect to a reference space relative to which the thing is at rest. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. In the case of an E26 Physical Feature the default reference space is the one in which the object that bears the feature or at least the surrounding matter of the feature is at rest. In this case there is a 1:1 relation of E26 Feature and E53 Place. For simplicity of implementation multiple inheritance \(E26 Feature IsA E53 Place\) may be a practical approach.
For instances of E19 Physical Objects the default reference space is the one which is at rest to the object itself, i.e. which moves together with the object. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces. 
This property is a shortcut of the fully developed path from ‘E18 Physical Thing’ through ‘P157 occupied’, ‘E92 Spacetime Volume’, ‘P159 has spatial projection’ to ‘E53 Place’. For some instances of E18 Physical Object the relative stability of form may not be sufficient to define a useful local reference space, for instance for an amoeba. In such cases the fully developed path to an external reference space and using a temporal validity component may be adequate to determine the place they have occupied.
In contrast to P156  occupies, the property P53 has former or current location identifies an instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time span.  Further it does not constrain this reference space of the referred instance of P53 Place.

      comment: %(This property associates an instance of E4 Period with the real that is phenomenal, 4 dimensional point set or volume in spacetime that it has occupied. The associated instance of E92 Spacetime Volume includes the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in the instance of E4 Period. This consists of the open spaces via which they have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event.
Such interactions took place in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event, such as the air in a meeting room transferring the voices. Another example are the areas controlled by some military power. In case of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are not regarded as part of the occupied spacetime volumes. Such instances of E4 Period occupy each a limited number of contiguous spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the total timespan covered by these spacetime volumes. The real spacetime volumes occupied by an instance of E4 Period must not be confused with declarations of spacetime approximating the real extent. In general, instances of E4 Period have fuzzy boundaries in spacetime.
Therefore it cannot be verified, if two different instances of E4 Period occupy exactly the same spacetime volume. We therefore determine that a spacetime volume may only be occupied by one instance of E4 Period.

The Person being born is linked to the Birth with the property P98 brought into life \(was born\). This is not intended for use with general natural history material, only people. There is no explicit method for modelling conception and gestation except by using extensions. This is a sub-property of P11 had participant \(participated in\).

      comment: %(This property links an E67 Birth event to an E21 Person in the role of biological father.
Note that biological fathers are not seen as necessary participants in the Birth, whereas birth-giving mothers are \(see P96 by mother \(gave birth\)\). The Person being born is linked to the Birth with the property P98 brought into life \(was born\).

A Birth event is normally \(but not always\) associated with one biological father.
