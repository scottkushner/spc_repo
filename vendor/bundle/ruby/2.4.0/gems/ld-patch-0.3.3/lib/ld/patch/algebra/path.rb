module LD::Patch::Algebra

  ##
  # The LD Patch `path` operator.
  #
  # The Path creates a closure over path operands querying `queryable` for terms having a relationship with the input `terms` based on each operand. The terms extracted from the first operand are used as inputs for the next operand until a final set of terms is found. These terms are returned as `RDF:Query::Solution` bound the the variable `?path`
  #
  # @example empty path
  #     (path)
  #
  #   Returns input terms
  #
  # @example forward path
  #     (path :p)
  #
  #   Queries `queryable` for objects where the input terms are subjects and the predicate is `:p`
  #
  # @example reverse path
  #     (path (reverse :p))
  #
  #   Queries `queryable` for subjects where input terms are objects and the predicate is `:p`, by executing the `reverse` operand using input terms to get a set of output terms.
  #
  # @example constraint
  #     (path (constraint (path) :c, 1))
  #
  #   Returns the input terms satisfying the constrant.
  #
  # @example chained path elements
  #     (path :p :q (constraint (path) :c, 1))
  #
  #   Maps terms using `(path :p)`, using them as terms for `(path :q)`, then subsets these based on the constraint.
