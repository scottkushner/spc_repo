    # A longpoll endpoint to wait for changes on an account. In conjunction
    # with list_folder, this call gives you a low-latency way to monitor an
    # account for file changes. The connection will block until there are
    # changes available or a timeout occurs. This endpoint is useful mostly
    # for client-side apps. If you're looking for server-side notifications,
    # check out our webhooks documentation.
    #
    # @param cursor [String] A cursor as returned by list_folder or
    #   list_folder_continue.
    # @option options timeout [Numeric] A timeout in seconds. The request will
    #   block for at most this length of time, plus up to 90 seconds of random
    #   jitter added to avoid the thundering herd problem. Care should be taken
    #   when using this parameter, as some network infrastructure does not
    #   support long timeouts. The default for this field is 30.
