Purposes of OM (based on notes from conversation with Matt Zumwalt):

1. Provide convenient names to access information in an XML document --
   essentially a declarative mechanism to define methods that will issue
   xpath queries against an XML document.

2. Provides a convient way to create new, empty XML documents (or fragments),
   with implied parent nodes (if any) and default attribute values (if any).
   This is done by overriding the class method xml_template() in your XML
   document class.

3. Provides a way to map your OM terminology into SOLR.
